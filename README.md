# CS50FinalProject
Final Project for CS50

In this project, I'm making a web application, where the user can dynamically create a new list and add/delete/modify its item(s). It will also notify the user if any item on the list is on discount, using an API from a government-provided website for grocery discounts in Hungary. Users will also have the possibility to share lists with each other, so everyone can modify the list.
